# Indonesian-GEC-framework
We proposed an automatic grammatical error correction framework based on the Transformer architecture and can be applied to other low-resource language texts. FurthermoreBesides, we built a large corpus of Indonesian language that can be utilized for evaluating the next Indonesian GEC task.
